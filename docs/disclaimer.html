<h1>Disclaimer &amp; Data Sources</h1>
<span class="updated">Last updated: 20 February 2026</span>

<h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>

<div class="callout">
<strong>SolSow provides general gardening information for educational purposes only. This is not professional agricultural, horticultural, or botanical advice.</strong>
</div>

<p>The planting information, growing calendars, companion planting suggestions, and gardening tips provided by SolSow are intended as general guidance only. The accuracy, completeness, and applicability of this information to your specific situation is not guaranteed.</p>

<h2>2. Accuracy Limitations</h2>
<p>The App uses a simplified growing zone system to provide planting recommendations. Important limitations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zone approximation:</strong> Each growing zone covers a broad geographic area. Your specific microclimate may differ significantly from zone-wide recommendations.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporal variation:</strong> Planting dates vary year to year based on weather patterns, frost dates, and seasonal conditions. The App provides general monthly guidance, not specific date recommendations.</li>
  <li><strong>Soil and site factors:</strong> The App does not account for your specific soil type, pH, drainage, elevation, aspect, wind exposure, or proximity to urban heat islands.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultivar differences:</strong> Different varieties of the same plant may have different growing requirements, maturity times, and climate tolerances.</li>
  <li><strong>Pest and disease:</strong> The App does not account for local pest and disease pressure, which varies significantly by region and season.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. No Liability for Outcomes</h2>
<p>SolSow, its developers, and contributors accept no liability for any outcomes resulting from use of the information provided, including but not limited to:</p>
